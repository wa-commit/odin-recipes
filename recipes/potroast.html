                    Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade lasagna:

                <ol class="step-instruction-list-lasagna">
                    <li>
                        <p>Gather all ingredients.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot) set to the Sauté function. Add roast to hot oil and cook until browned all over, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Pour in broth.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Combine potatoes, carrots, onion, soup mix, and remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a resealable plastic bag. Seal the bag and shake until vegetables are evenly coated.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Pour mixture into the pressure cooker and spread out evenly.</p>
                        
                    </li>
                        <p>Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to the manufacturer's instructions; set the timer for 60 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for the pressure to build. Release the pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to the manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.</p>                    
                    <li>
                        <p>Let the lasagna rest before serving.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Transfer roast and vegetables to a serving platter, leaving drippings in the pot.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Select the Sauté function and bring drippings to a boil. Combine water and cornstarch in a bowl; pour into the drippings. Cook, stirring frequently, until gravy is slightly thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Season with garlic salt and pepper. Slice roast and serve with vegetables and gravy.</p>
