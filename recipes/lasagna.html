                    <li>Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of
                        flavor.</li>
                    <li>Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans
                        of tomato paste.</li>
                    <li>Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.

                        Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
                    <li>Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.
