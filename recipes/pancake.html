                    Our banana bread is one of the most popular and well-reviewed videos I've ever posted. When I got
                    the idea to do banana bread pancakes, I decided to use that lovely loaf as the base recipe.

                    Of course, you can't just thin out a bread recipe like that with more liquid and expect perfect
                    pancakes. I began what I assumed would be a long series of experiments, eventually leading to the
                    perfect formula.
                    So, you can imagine my shock when I nailed it on the first attempt. Like they say, it's better to be
                    lucky than good. I didn't want banana-flavored pancakes, nor did I want pan-fried banana bread
                    dough. Rather, I wanted a perfect hybrid of both — and that's pretty much what happened here.
                    The toughest decision was whether or not to add the finely chopped dark chocolate to the batter,
                    which is the secret ingredient that I believe makes our banana bread so irresistible. It also makes
                    it richer, and a little more dessert-like. soI erred on the side of more savory, since we are making
                    breakfast after all. But, please, feel free to add some in if you'd like. It should work well. Very
                    well.
                    Other tweaks could involve topping this with some caramelized banana slices, a la bananas Foster, or
                    maybe sneaking a little splash of spiced rum into the mix. Or just make them exactly as shown, since
                    they really were fabulous. Anyway, whether you enjoy these tricked-up for dessert or as-is for
                    breakfast, I really do hope you give these a try soon. Enjoy!

                    Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make Banana Bread Pancake:

            <div class="step-instruction-list">
                <ol class="step-instruction-list-pancake">
                    <li>
                        <p>Combine flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda in a small bowl with a whisk. Reserve until needed.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>CPlace banana in a mixing bowl and mash into a smooth paste with a potato masher. Add egg and sugar and whisk thoroughly until sugar is dissolved and mixture is smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add milk, vanilla extract, 1/4 cup melted butter, walnuts, and flour mixture. Whisk until just combined.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Let batter rest for 10 minutes.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large, nonstick pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot, transfer in about 1/3 cup of the batter per pancake. Reduce heat to medium and cook until edges start to look dry and small air bubbles pop up through the surface, about 3 minutes. Flip and cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes more. Serve immediately.</p>
